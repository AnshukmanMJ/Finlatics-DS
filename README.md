Digital Marketing Analysis: Customer Segmentation & Churn Prediction
Overview
This project performs a comprehensive data science analysis on a synthetic digital marketing dataset. The primary goals are twofold:

Customer Segmentation: Use unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing and engagement behavior.

Churn Prediction: Build a supervised learning model (Logistic Regression) to predict which customers are likely to churn.

The script is a self-contained Jupyter Notebook or Python file that generates its own sample data for demonstration purposes, making it fully reproducible.

Key Analyses & Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis and visualization of customer demographics and behavioral metrics.

K-Means Clustering:

Uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of customer segments.

Groups customers into segments like "High-Value Veterans," "New Engaged Users," or "At-Risk Low Spenders."

Visualizes these segments based on key metrics like tenure and total spending.

Predictive Modeling:

Trains a Logistic Regression model to predict customer churn.

Evaluates the model's performance using an accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Actionable Insights:

Analyzes the churn rate within each identified customer segment, providing targeted insights for marketing retention campaigns.
